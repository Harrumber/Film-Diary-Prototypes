This film diary is a project for my college NEA
This application works similarly to Letterboxd, or IMDb as that is where I got my inspiration from and it allows the user to keep a collection for the movies they've watched
The user can rate movies, save movies to the watchlist, and find recommendations for movies they might like, generated by my algorithm
This is the latest video showcasing the app: https://youtu.be/7-FgLMQ4Iso
